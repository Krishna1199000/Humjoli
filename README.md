This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/humjoli"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Cloudinary (for production image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

### Setting up Cloudinary

1. Sign up for a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Go to your Dashboard to get your credentials
3. Add the credentials to your `.env.local` file
4. For production, add these same environment variables to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## Image Upload

This application uses Cloudinary for image uploads, which works in both development and production environments. Images are automatically optimized and served via CDN for better performance.
